<b><i>Why You Need a Portfolio Website</b></i>

In a nutshell, I built this portfolio website to showcase my work. Whether you’re an individual, a small team of two or a company of ten people, it’s crucial that you have a unique online approach. A website portfolio will help you stand out from the crowd, show your uniqueness, build trust, and make sure that others can actually find you.
